> Tiny the Stone Giant is a melee Strength hero with powerful ganking and killing potential. Although he starts off vulnerable in lane with his pitiful mana pool and almost non-existent armor, with a few levels, he gets considerably stronger. His killing power in the early and midgame comes from comboing his two active abilities.
